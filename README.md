## Description
Lightly, a mobile application which sends alerts to its users about light pollution of that area where the user currently is or the user's destination. Another crucial information the users can know is if ozone layer depletion is taking place or not. The app has 5 tabs altogether. The main three tabs among those are “Scan for pollution” tab to view the intensity level of pollution, “Detect UV ray” to visualize which areas has the harmful effects of UV rays and “Suggestion” tab from where users can get suggestion how they can eradicate light pollution and safe themselves from the UV rays.
Using the “Scan for pollution” tab, the user is able to see an image tile. The image is generated by using NASA’S  GIBS API that provides us with a global satellite dataset as map imagery. The app tracks the user's location data to request relevant satellite imagery and notifies the user of any pollution alerts in their nearby area. Moreover, In order to automatically determine the severity level of pollution in the satellite data supplied from NASA's GIBS API, image analysis techniques are integrated in the backend. The app notifies the user of notifications with information about the intensity level of the pollution after the analysis is finished. 
Our app retrieves images of the Earth's ozone layer from a specific API and does analysis to determine the UV rays' health. The ozone layer is essential in shielding life on Earth from dangerous UV radiation and our app seeks to tell users about the UV ray situation in their area at that moment. Therefore users can use the tab “ detect UV ray” to know about the UV ray situation around them. 
Then comes the “Suggestion” tab where app users can get suggestions on how they then eradicate the light pollution and protect themselves from the harmful UV rays. The suggestion tab will provide some suggestions.
